# Meraki-Web-Gateway
A web server that provides a hyperlinked version of the Meraki API JSON.

# Requirements
Groovy and curl need to be available for the gateway server to run.

# Run
Use start_server.sh to run it.  

# Usage
The gateway is intended to be used by a browser that nicely displays JSON and
allows links to be followed. Chrome with an appropriate extension works well.
